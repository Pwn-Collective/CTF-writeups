## Write-up
The given text has very distinct syntax. We notice that it has a lot of symbols † or ‡ which looks like a dagger. This is a characteristics of a GOLD-BUG ciphertext, which can be found here: >https://www.dcode.fr/gold-bug-poe.

Using Gold-Bug Decoder we got this:

>“CAPTAI KIDD USED THE GOLD BUG CIPHER TO HIDE THE LOCATIO OF HIS TREASURE I A STORY WRITTE BY EDGAR ALLA POE I FLAG IS PIRATESANDDAGGERS”

So our flag is:

>'PIRATESANDDAGGERS'
