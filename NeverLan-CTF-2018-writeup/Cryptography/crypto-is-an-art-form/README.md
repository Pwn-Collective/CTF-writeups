## Write-up
In this problem we were given a picture that looks a lot like a QR CODE. 

We googled all the possible well-known ciphers that use pictures, and suddenly we managed to find this:
> https://www.dcode.fr/betamaze-cipher#q3

It was a little bit of luck and a little bit of googling skills, but after decryption we got this:

>’NOTAQRCODEITSBETAMAZE’

Next time you see a mazy-qr-code looking picture, just know it’s a Betamaze Cipher.

The flag turned out to be:

>ITSBETAMAZE
